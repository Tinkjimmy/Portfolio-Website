    <p>By Giacomo Duca</p>
    <section id="about-the-project">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Movie app is a single-page, responsive web application
            that allows users to registrate,update personal data,
            browse through a rich movies list and saving movies in a
            user specific favorite movie list.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="purpose-context">
        <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
        <p>This application was meant to be part of my web development course, to both
            exercise and show my newly acquired skills In full-stack javascript development.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="objective">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective was to create a full project to put on display on my portfolio-website. The challenge was to build the application from the ground up both
            in the back and in the front-end part of it.
            The use of React was meant to give the application scalability an a better
            UI.
            </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technologies">
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>Utilizes Postman, React, Bootstrap, Heroku, and the MERN Stack.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="server-side">
        <h2>Server Side</h2>
        <p>On the server side I used Node.js and Express to create a REST
            API.
            The API was used to communicate with a MongoDB
            database(Mongoose was used to interact with the database) using
            GET and POST methods to fetch and save data from and to it.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Setup
            </h3>
            <p>
                The choice of a non relational
database granted me the
flexible setting I needed,
allowing me to store data in a
more dynamic format.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Models
            </h3>
            <p>
                I then drew models (despite
MongoDb being a schema-less
database) in order to
facilitate efficient data storage,
retrieval, and updating.
I created API end points and
defined routes and handlers
for each of them.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Authentication & authorization
            </h3>
            <p>
                Authentication and authorization was an important step
                to secure the application, I installed packages for basic
                HTTP authentications(for initial login) and JWT(JSON Web
                Token) authentication using Passport(to authenticate
                and authorize subsequent requests after the initial
                login).
                An ulterior layer of security was put in place by adding
                Password hashing in my user schema ans integrating
                CORS to check which domains were allowed to make
                requests.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Deployment
            </h3>
            <p>
                I then deployed the API on
Heroku , while the database
was uploaded to MongoDB
Atlas and i
performed a final round of
testing using Postman .
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section id="client-side">
        <h2>Client Side</h2>
        <p>I designed the client side as a single-page
            application developed using React and React-redux.
            The UI allows the user to view a list of movies and
            info about them, register through the sign up view,
            login and review his personal information in the
            profile view.
            </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>I designed the client side as a single-page
            application developed using React and React-redux.
            The UI allows the user to view a list of movies and
            info about them, register through the sign up view,
            login and review his personal information in the
            profile view.</p>
        <h3>Style</h3>
        <p>I utilized React Bootstrap to style the app, making
            use of its components such as Cards and Forms,
            and leveraging the grid system for layout and
            responsiveness.</p>
        <h3>MVC Architecture
        </h3>
        <p>I chose React as a framework to create the client
            side so that I could get familiar with the MVC
            architecture as a design pattern, also tacking
            advantage of its flexibility, rich ecosystem and
            strong community support.
            Learning how to build components in this
            environment was extremely useful since
            components allow for a modular approach to
            building the UI, making the codebase easier to
            manage and extend.
            </p>
        <h3>Final product</h3>
        <p>The last step was to implement Redux, to learn
            how it manages state changes, making them
            predictable through a unidirectional data flow.
            I then hosted the project on Netlify.</p>

    <section id="retrospective">
        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <h3>What went well</h3>
        <p>the initial phase of creating the API went
            exceptionally well. The clear definition of endpoints, models,
            and the thoughtful structuring of the database laid a strong
            foundation for the project. Leveraging Node.js and Express
            made the backend robust and scalable.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <h4>Time Management</h4>
        <p>Juggling full-time work while
            dedicating sufficient time to the project was the most
            challenging aspect. Finding balance often meant
            sacrificing weekends and evenings to maintain project
            momentum.</p>
        <h4>Learning Curve</h4>
        <p> Grasping new concepts, especially
            Redux and advanced React patterns, required a
            considerable investment of time and effort.</p>
        <h3>Future improvement</h3>
        <p>More emphasis could be placed on implementing automated tests from the early
            stages. Testing could enhance reliability and facilitate easier refactoring and feature
            additions.
            The UI could also benefit from a restyling</p>

    <section id="final-thoughts">
        <h1>Fianl Thoughts</h1>
    <p>The experience of developing the myFlix app, from
        backend to frontend, has been immensely rewarding. It
        has not only solidified my understanding of full-stack
        development principles but also enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to learn and adapt to new
        technologies rapidly. Balancing this project with full-time
        work responsibilities underscored the importance of time
        management, perseverance, and the value of practical,
        hands-on learning.</p>
